## Get started
Edit files in /src folder

To run the development version with live reload, etc:

```
  npm run watch
```

To run the production build:

```
  npm run build
```

Copy the content of /build to your production server for production deployment.

## OPTIONAL

You can add Bootstrap 4 by running:

```
  npm install jquery popper.js bootstrap
```

Make sure to uncomment the loaders in app.js and style.scss. Bootstrap4 is then ready to go!
